# predicting-survival-on-the-Titanic-with-Python
Project Overview




This project analysis the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic. The analysis aims to explore the data, perform data cleaning, and extract insights through visualizations. The main objective is to understand the factors that influenced the survival rate of the passengers.


Installing Python libraries:


pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn



###Dataset###


Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and save it in your working directory.


###Steps###



Load Data: Load the Titanic dataset using Pandas.



Data Cleaning:

Drop unnecessary columns (PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin).


Fill missing Age values with the mean age.

Analysis & Visualisation:

Survival Rate: Calculate and plot overall survival rates.


By Gender: Analyze survival rates by gender using bar plots.


By Age: Visualise age distribution with survival status using histograms.




###Conclusions###



The analysis of the Titanic dataset revealed key factors that influenced the survival of passengers:

Gender: Female passengers had a much higher chance of survival.


Age: Younger passengers, particularly those under 10 years old, had a better chance of surviving.


Overall Survival Rate: The survival rate was relatively low, with only 38% of passengers surviving.


These insights provide a deeper understanding of the tragic event and the factors that played a role in passenger survival.
